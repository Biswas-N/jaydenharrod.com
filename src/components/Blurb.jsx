                I&#x27;m a digital media generalist specifically interested in front-end engineering and filmmaking. I&#x27;ve been doing both for over 8 years now and absolutely love it. As part of the journey, I&#x27;ve also picked up design, audio, growth hacking, and business skills.      </p>
            <p>
                This has lead to some interesting work!

                I ran operations for an e-commerce server hosting company. Gathered millions of views as a YouTuber. And created content for Australia&#x27;s biggest tech brands at Digivizer.
