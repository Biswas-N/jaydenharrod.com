            <p>
                I&#x27;m a digital media generalist specifically interested in front-end engineering and filmmaking. I&#x27;ve been doing both for over 8 years now and absolutely love it. As part of the journey, I&#x27;ve also picked up design, audio, growth hacking, and business skills.      </p>
            <p>
                As a result, I&#x27;ve done some interesting work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ran operations for an e-commerce server hosting company. Gathered millions of views as a YouTuber. And created content for Australia&#x27;s biggest tech brands at Digivizer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I&#x27;m living less of an entrepreneurial life and focusing on a balanced lifestyle.
