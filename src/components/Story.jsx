      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a digital media generalist with experience in Web Development,
        DevOps, Video Production, Photography, Music Production, and Digital Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ran global operations for an e-commerce hosting company. Gathered millions of views as a YouTuber. And created content for Australia's biggest tech brands at Digivizer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I'm living less of the hustle life and focusing on what's most important. Currently, that's being a Front End Engineer, telling stories through filmmaking, my mental and physical health, and friends and family. Please take a look around and contact me if you'd like to say hello!
