        <Paragraph>
          2019 was the year of change. I moved cities, worked 3 different jobs,
          and lived in 3 different places. After 3 years of dealing with the
          anxiety that comes with an over populated city, the impossible
          financial demands, and the logistical nightmare involved when
          socialising with friends or spending time outdoors. I decided that
          there must be a better life to be had outside of Sydney, and that the
          job hub of Australia wasn't the only answer for a successful career.
          After all, I was previously living in a small country town, Sydney was
          not my identity or a place I saw myself living long-term. With the
          reward potentials high and the timing right, I took a huge risk and
          moved back to my hometown of Newcastle, NSW to completely redefine how
          I lived my life in 2019.
